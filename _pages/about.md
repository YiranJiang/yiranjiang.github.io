<h2 style="text-align: left;">About Me</h2>

I am an Assistant Professor of Statistics in the University of Kentucky. I was a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Biostatistics at Yale University, supervised by Prof. [Heping Zhang](https://ysph.yale.edu/c2s2/profile/heping-zhang/). I completed my Ph.D. in Statistics at Purdue University in 2023, where I was supervised by Prof. [Chuanhai Liu](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~chuanhai/). Before that, I received my Master degree in Statistics from Columbia University in 2019, supervised by Prof. [Tian Zheng](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/). I received my Bachelor degree in Economics from Fudan University in 2017.  

My research focuses on developing valid and efficient methodologies for statistical analysis. I am particularly interested in designing tools that are grounded in fundamental statistical principles while also integrating advances from modern machine learning and artificial intelligence. Specifically, my research interests include:
- Statistical foundations of data science and machine learning
- Reliable methods for predictive modeling and statistical inference
- Statistical genetics and the application of statistical methods to biomedical data

<!-- <p><u>Iâ€™m excited to join the <a href="https://stat.as.uky.edu/faculty">Dr. Bing Zhang Department of Statistics at the University of Kentucky</a> as an Assistant Professor in August 2025!</u></p> -->
